This guide will maintain our styling standards for our Data Visualisation project. We will stick to this not only within our group components, but our individual components too. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this document and finalising a style guide we are happy with and comfortable to stick to.

We appreciate anyone who is taking the time to read our contributing file -  we look forward to seeing your contributions and feedback.

# General
 
* Prefer single quotes over double quotes
```
Do this   ‘Comment’
Not this  “Comment”                               
```
* Acknowledge all third party scripts using comments 
* Function and variables names should be logical and descriptive
```
Do this   ‘AddListItem’
Not this  ‘ListItem”
```
* Use the DRY principle, no repetition

* Keep the line length under 80 spaces

# Formatting
* Scoped Vue Styles
```
 <style scoped>
</style>
```
* Block comment Style 
```
 /*
 * This is fIne 
 */ and 
 // This is fine. 
```
 * Don’t have large spaces in code
* Always use semicolons
```
Do this   function (name){}; 
Not this  function (name){}
```
* Single-file components should always order <template>, <script> and <style> tags consistently, with <style> last, because at least one of the other two is always necessary

Not this  a>b
